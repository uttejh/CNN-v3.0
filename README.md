# CNN-v3.0

A Convolutional Neural Network used for the recognition of Handwritten characters (numbers) using Deep Learning. The system was
purely implemented from the scratch without using any existing tools such as Tensorflow, Matlab, Keras, etc... The architecture is
based on the <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">book</a> by <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/">Michael Nielsen</a>.

# Built-With
